# 9.0 Practical Exercises

WIMMA Lab is a good environment to try out different exercises. This chapter includes exercises conducted in the summer of 2018 and can be freely applied for your own purposes.

Exercises aim to team up WIMMA Labs, because a good team spirit in such a fast project is very important. Some of the exercises also aim to create a better understanding of the product itself so that the team has a unified goal.

The coach mainly draws all the exercises, because especially in the early stages the teams may have a “ball lost” and may need to be encouraged and encouraged more than normal. In some cases (depending on the situation), it is advisable to give the team leaders, for example, a spy walking, filling a Product Canvas, and creating their own rules of the team.

### 9.1 Superheroes

**Duration:** 20-30 minutes per team. (A team of five people used in the rating. Time increases if there are more members in the team.)  
**Purpose:** Getting to know the team members in a relaxed atmosphere.  
**Please note:** For each team member, print your own paper in advance. The pens and gums must be adequately booked. It is good to do the exercise in a quiet place without distractions.

The purpose of SuperSank is to introduce itself to other team members with a small, playful turn. References to SWOT analysis (S = Strengths, W = Weaknesses, O = Opportunities, T = Threats) are included.

Conducting a team-specific exercise, each presenting itself to its own team.

#### Initial phase

Share paper with team blank on one side and questions on the other side:  
Introduce yourself as a super hero

* What is your super hero name?  
* How do you look?  
* Where do you come from?  
* What is your superpower? Why?  
* What about your weakness? Why?  
* Who is your archbishop? Why?  
* Do you have a slogan? What is it?

Other questions can be answered in writing, but "What you look like" would be to draw on the blank side of the paper. Everyone draws on their own level; here it is to be understood that not everyone is top-notch. The most important thing is to try.

Each answer should describe itself, but of course imagination can be used for the answers.

#### Presentation Stage

Go through the team with each of your heroes one by one. It is very important to remember that **no superhero can be judged or criticized**. Other team members (and it is highly desirable) to ask questions like “Why…” and “How…”.

Volunteer: The team invents their own name, cf. Avengers. Later, the teams present themselves to everyone else and tell about themselves and their superpowers.

An example of a superhero who attended WIMMA Lab in the summer of 2018:
> *Superhero name: Doggonator.  
> Where are you from: Joensuu countryside.  
> What is Your Super Power: Effective Waxing for Dogs. I can create a friendship with over 10 Dogen in 60 seconds.  
> What about your weakness: Sunny terrace. Dogs are not saved because of frost.  
> Who is your archbishop: Cats. And 80 cm wide beds.  
> Issue: Your dog is now my dog.*

### 9.2 Team Canvas

**Duration:** 20-30 minutes per team. (A team of five people used in the rating. Time increases if there are more members in the team.)  
**Purpose:** Getting to know the team, mapping the skills of team members, finding common goals.  
**Please note:** One Team Canvas template must be printed in advance for the team (see Appendix 1). The pen must be reserved for writing. It is good to do the exercise in a quiet place without distractions.

Team Canvas is the starting point for creating a team's own atmosphere. Completing Team Canvas helps to clarify team goals and motivation factors. It helps to find answers, among others. to the following:

* What are the goals of the whole team? What about the goals of individual team members?
* What expertise do members bring to the team?
* What are the core values of the team?
* How does the team communicate with each other? How to make decisions? How to make plans and evaluate their implementation?

(Understanding Team Canvas, 2015).

Team Canvas can be filled in freely by talking. Everybody's opinions and thoughts are recorded and we see if things are common to everyone. Alternatively, each team member can complete his / her thoughts on post-it tags, which they will be disassembled together and recorded on common issues.

### 9.3 Product Canvas

**Duration:** One hour per team.  
**Purpose:** Getting to know the product from your workstation. Understanding the unified goal.  
**Please note:** One Product Canvas base must be printed in advance for the team (see Appendix 2). The pen must be reserved for writing. Goodbye Plussa.

A common image of the assignment received is of paramount importance, Product Product Can help create the same understanding of the goal for all team members (Product Canvas, 2018).

Product Canvas helps to clarify eg the following things:

* Why would the user want to buy / use this product?
* What should the product look like?
* How would the user use the product?

The team should leave the office and fill the Product Canvas with each other. Going outside (for example with ice cream) is highly desirable and strengthens the team spirit.

### 9.4 Moving Motivators

**Duration:** 10-20 minutes per person.  
**Purpose:** Identify the personal motivation factors of each WIMMA Labile while exploring the two.  
**Please note:** Two Moving Motivators cards must be pre-printed (see Appendix 3). Provide a quiet space with no distractions.

The Moving Motivators exercise comes from Management 3.0 and is done with 1-on-1 with every WIMMA Labian. In addition to mapping motivation factors, the coach gets the chance to get to know WIMMA Labila and ask how he's gone.

Cards are arranged in a clear line that shows the order of priority (for example, the least important to the left and the most important to the right) (Management 3.0 Practice: Moving Motivators, N.d). It is worth encouraging the reflection on the sound, as at the same time you get an understanding of the other's thinking world (Yle Lean Culture Toolkit, 2018). Not all cards are required to be used, but you must justify why you have not used a particular card.

When WIMMA Labi has got their own cards arranged, the coach puts their own line up.  
Questions you can ask may include:

* Why are the cards in this order? What do they mean to you?
* Do you tell me a little why these three cards are the most important?
* Do you tell me a little why these three cards are the least important?
* Was it difficult to determine the order?
* Is there one, right order?
* If you had done this two years ago, would your order be different?
* If you did this in two years, would the order be different?
* What do you find in our ranks?
* What's different in our ranks?
* Why is it important for me to know what is most important to you?

Questions can be asked as needed, and if they raise new questions as a result of the discussion, they should be presented. Each conversation is different.

If time is left, you can do the exercise again when WIMMA Lab approaches the end and see if something has changed.

The exercise can also be pulled by one team at a time, but this requires a lot of trust in other people. At least in the early stages, it is advisable to do the exercise twice. Creating a safe atmosphere is important.

### 9.5 Team Rules

**Duration:** 10-20 minutes per team.  
**Purpose:** To create a team's common game rules that all team members commit to.  
**Please note:** For each team, a large piece of paper and a marker to write the rules must be reserved (Malin, 2017).

The team makes its own rules of the game, which are followed by the entire WIMMA Lab. However, the rules can (and should) be updated if the situation changes or the rules no longer make sense (Yle Lean Culture Toolkit, 2018).

For example, the following guidelines can be used to create rules:

1. Each team member lists himself on paper 5 (or more, if one comes to mind) to help the team work as efficiently as possible.
2. Proposals are passed through and voted for inclusion in the rules of the game.
3. The rules of the game are recorded on a large piece of paper that is placed in the place the entire team sees it.

However, it is not advisable to make the rules too much, about 5 to 6 rules per team is the right amount.

### 9.6 Lean Coffee

**Duration:** Throughout the WIMMA Lab.  
**Purpose:** Get answers to questions when you can get them.  
**Please note:** Book one table only for this use. Pencils and post-it pencil placed on the table.

The Lean Coffee idea has been adapted to make WIMMA Lab more suitable for Yle Lean Culture Toolkit (2018).

Technical support and other guidance is not always immediately available as there are many other projects in progress for the teaching staff. On a dedicated table, anyone can write a question about the post-it issue with their own name. While walking, the instructor looks at the questions on the table and knows how to go to talk to the right person on the subject.

Here's how WIMMA Labs get help as soon as possible when a coach can't help.

### 9.7 Meet & Greet

**Duration:** 30-60 minutes.  
**Purpose:** Learn to briefly and concisely tell about your own work and learn to shake hands with another person.  
**Please note:** Everyone should practice their own pitching before training. During the exercise, the speech should be well known from the outside.  
These two exercises should be kept together, as both require a lot of repetition.

Pitchaus is a short sales speech where a person tries to bring his or her expertise quickly to a potential employer, for example.  
For example, in pitching, you can tell:

* Who are you?
* What can you do? How does a speaker benefit from knowledge?
* How do you differ from others?

The pitch should last about 30-60 seconds. It is advisable to practice Pitchaus a few times, even at the mirror before performing the exercise itself.

After the Pitchus is presented, another person is handled. The handshake should not be too fussy, and not too strong on the other hand. When handled, it is a good way to look at another eye as it shows reliability. Most often, the right hand is used for handshake.

Participants are divided into two groups that stand in opposition to each other. Everyone speaks of his own pitch, in turn, and then hides the opposite person. The second line then moves so that there is always a new person opposite. The same will be repeated until the first person's face is on his own.

There are many variations of the implementation that can be made, the most important is the number of repetitions and the feedback. After every pitching and handshake it would be good to have feedback and justification. For example, “Well it went” is not enough, but it would be good to ask for clarifications like “What was that good about it? What's wrong? ”Based on the feedback received, your speech and handshake can be improved the next time.

### 9.8 Happiness Wall

**Duration:** 5-10 minutes.  
**Purpose:** To give constructive feedback in a meaningful and timely manner.  
**Please note:** Make enough post-spores and pens.  
This exercise can be held, for example, after another exercise, to get instant feedback from it.

Three post-it tapes taped to the wall; together there is a happy face, in another neutral face and in the third sad face. Each participant writes his / her own feedback on a clean post-it and leaves it under his or her desired face (Management 3.0 Practice: Happiness Door Increases Employee Engagement, 2015).

In the feedback, it is particularly important to justify why you left such feedback. If someone went well, why? If someone went wrong, why? Based on the feedback received, the exercise can be improved the next time and the opinions can be taken into account immediately when things are still in the memory.

It is advisable to leave the room for a moment, so that participants can leave their feedback peacefully and anonymously.

Examples of feedback from pitching and handshake exercises in summer 2018:
> *There should have been more improvisation than in the right situation. Otherwise OK.*  
>  
> *Pitchauses improved towards the end because of repetitions! That's okay.*
>  
> *Otherwise good, but training is not enough in the circle to rotate.*

### 9.9 LinkedIn Account

**Duration:** 30-60 minutes.  
**Purpose:** To create good starting points for networking. Get a base for a professional network.  
**Please note:** It is worth doing in English (especially in the IT field).

LinkedIn serves as a meeting place for employees and employers. In particular, the IT industry should have a LinkedIn account done and the profile up to date. A well-made profile helps build a professional network.

Below are some general guidelines to follow when making a relevant LinkedIn profile:

* **Avoid the needles!** Punctuate your text with something else.
* A profile photo of a clear photo of your face (no full-body film), no jerking! No other people, no animals, no objects, etc. Good picture of professionalism. For example, you can put a piece of work on a background image.
* If you are looking for a job, bring it right in the title.
* The Summary section should be interesting, clear and informative. It is not advisable to make the summary too long. Highlight your core competencies. French lines can be used.
* Clearly featured contact information, for example, in the Summary section first.
* Work experience is written from the newest to the oldest (newest at the top). Tell a little about work tasks and the programs / tools used.
* The public profile helps you find something to find... You can change publicity in settings.
* Removing a useless hijacker from the URL. You can also make the settings.

When the profile is done and spelled out, **networking!** Send contact requests to at least every WIMMA Lab and Coach. If you visit companies, please send a contact request immediately after your visit so you don't forget your mind.

### 9.10 Mob Programming

**Duration:** 4 hours (or more).  
**Purpose:** Learn to communicate within a team.  
**Please note:** Required software must be preinstalled on your computer (and tested to work). A large common display (eg TV or video projector) should be available. It is good to do the exercise in a quiet place without distractions.

The exercise is aimed especially at the software side, but not all participants need to be programmers. Everyone can participate in their own skills.

Mob Programming means that all team members work together to achieve the same goal, at the same time, in the same state and on the same computer (Mob Programming, A Whole Team Approach - Woody Zuill, 2017).

One team member is “Driver” and the rest is “Navigators”. The role changes at agreed time intervals, for example every 10 minutes.

The task of the navigators is to talk to each other and give instructions to the Driver who executes the instructions on the computer. The driver output level must be taken into account when giving instructions, as not everyone can program. Navigators can also advise you on searching for Driver and tell you what you need to do with Google.

The role of Driver is to encode what the Navigators advise. The driver should not be involved in the reflection, for example he should not make suggestions "Wouldn't this be better?". However, the driver may ask for instructions on unclear issues such as "How is this written?".

![Mysticons mob programming](../images/image029.jpg)  
*Mysticons Solve the Secret Messagea Mob Programming Exercise.*

Mob Programming has many benefits, including:

* Producing a clearer code.
* There are no merger conflicts when only one code is made at a time.
* There is no need for meetings, everyone stays in the situation.
* Everyone's opinions are taken into account.
* Learn from others, and knowledge is not just one person's head.
* It is fun!

It is a good task for the team to take on a non-missionary task so that everyone can form a common understanding of the new problem. WIMMA Lab used the Secret Message programming nut provided by Wunderdog (Secret Message, 2016).

Before starting the task, you should remind the team of good communication rules: treat others with kindness, respect and attentiveness.
