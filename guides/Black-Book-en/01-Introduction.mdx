# 1.0 Introduction

You are holding the very first WIMMA Lab Black Book in your hands!

It is a guide for anyone interested in getting to know more about WIMMA Lab's activities and practices. The guide has been compiled from proven exercises and tips that have been tested under real conditions.

Black Book author, Minttu Mäkäläinen, worked as a head coach at the WIMMA Lab in Jyväskylä University of Applied Sciences in the summer of 2018. She wrote Black Book as her thesis based on the summer experiences.

The images used include members from virtual companies Iotitude, Overflow, Mysticons and Pengwin Media in the summer of 2018.

### 1.1 What is WIMMA Lab?

WIMMA Lab is a project learning model launched by Marko “Narsu”, a teacher at Jyväskylä University of Applied Sciences. At WIMMA Lab students can practice the skills they learn at school with real assignments given by different companies and employers - students have also the opportunity to learn new things that are not necessarily taught at the school.

Students are divided into different virtual companies, small groups where they act as employees for two and a half months (more about virtual companies, see chapter 5). Students accumulate internships during the project and gain work experience in their field.

WIMMA Lab is looking for different assignments for students by utilizing existing networks and seeking the right customers for virtual companies. At the same time, students get to expand their network with experts in the field and get in touch with new companies and contacts.

WIMMA Lab uses methods based on the ideology of agile development, such as working on a sprint model and Kanban charts (read more in chapter 8). New practices are constantly tested and embedded in the process if they are perceived as good.

### 1.2 Main Objectives of WIMMA Lab

The main purpose of WIMMA Lab is to teach students how to work in groups using agile product development methods, and to develop problem solving skills. At the same time, students will learn about the different processes of service design that are used in real working life. Assignments are sought to address the needs of the right customer.

Another main purpose is to develop business cooperation and discover new technologies. Students are more likely to be recruited when they are able to apply the latest technology in practical work. During WIMMA Lab, students will also be able to create contacts with business representatives, which will help to find a job later.
