# 3.0 Facilities and Equipment

In the summer of 2018, two classrooms were reserved for Wimma Lab's premises at the Jyväskylä University of Applied Sciences. The most optimal situation is that all participants in the project can be seated in the same room. The coach should also fit into the same space so that he / she can be actively involved in everyday activities.

The facilities and equipment to be used should be clarified as soon as possible, as it is important to start working immediately when WIMMA Lab starts.

Each participant should be booked at least

* one large enough desk
* An office chair that can seat 8 hours a day (note ergonomics!),
* A powerful enough computer to do the job
* Mouse and Mousepad
* Keyboard
* Display (two displays per person recommended).

Table layouts should also take into account the needs of the network implementation, such as the location of the network plugs and the adequacy of the power lines. Every machine should have a well-functioning Internet connection to perform the job.

From the point of view of the usability of the premises, it is also advisable to bring enough racks and trash cans to critical locations. For potential guests, it is good to have extra chairs available.

The requirements of the assignments should be remembered when designing the premises. For example, if there is a lot of hardware used, the goods may not fit into the workstations of the participants. It is also good to reserve extra tables for virtual companies. For design work, it would be a good idea to have mobile flip charts available.

The formation of open office space should be avoided due to noise. To reduce noise, movable scissors can be placed in the space at suitable locations. Serms also create visual protection and allow teams to create their own work areas.

It is worth investing in the comfort of the premises, for example in the form of artificial plants. Team members can be advised to bring their own coffee cups and posters for the duration of the project to make their workspace look like. You should also include your own headphones as they help you achieve personal peace of mind.

It is worthwhile to take into account the amount of noise caused by people in a break and its impact on the people who work. If it is found to cause too much interference in the placement of the pause mode in the working space, it is advisable to place it outside the workspace. The space should also be reserved for a coffee point.
