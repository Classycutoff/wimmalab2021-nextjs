# 7.0 WIMMA Lab Selection Process

The main purpose of the selection process is to get motivated students at WIMMA Lab who can work in a self-organizing team of experts. The most optimal situation would be if the applicants had already been in some sort of summer job to get familiar with the practice of working life.

Assignments must be clear in time for the selection process to find the right kind of expertise.

### 7.1 Applying for an Interview

WIMMA Lab is not necessarily accessible to anyone who wants it, because the number of participants should be considered reasonable in relation to the size and assignments of the premises. In the summer of 2018, there were 28 students at WIMMA Lab. The opportunity to apply for WIMMA Lab is good to open as soon as possible and interviews should be organized for applicants.

Interviewees are advised to interview either individually or in pairs. Even two interviewees can make the situation more difficult, as the other may be under the guise of another if, for example, a very quiet person is involved. If the interviewee misses her, she must be given the opportunity to speak.

There are more than one interviewer to be able to compare the images created during the interview with each other after the interview. As a rule, the founder of WIMMA Lab, who is responsible for the action, acts as the interviewer. It is also a good idea for the coach to be involved in the interviews as he / she will work with selected people every day for the duration of the WIMMA Lab. In addition, it is advisable to be technically skilled persons who, if necessary, assist in the identification of the applicant's technical ability.

Particular attention should be paid to interviews, for example. to the following:

* The planned implementation schedule is for the interviewee; he / she must not have other overlapping costs that hinder full-time participation. WIMMA Lab's working hours are 8â€“16 on weekdays according to normal working hours.
* Character, is the interviewee open, who freely talks about things? Or a quieter listener? Happy and brisk?
    - You should try to detect negative attitudes and unwillingness at this stage and eliminate them.
* Motivation mapping, is it there? It does not come out so clearly with everyone, even if motivation is found.
* Points of interest that you would particularly like to learn from WIMMA Lab.
    - Requires the applicant to familiarize himself / herself with the available assignments.
* What do you already know?
* Is the interviewee willing to act as a team leader? Each team should have a clear leader from the beginning.

It is worth trusting your own impression of a person because it tells a lot. If necessary, a new interview can be arranged later if there is ambiguity in the choices.

### 7.2 Selections of Participants

When all those who are interested are interviewed, you can start thinking about preliminary team divisions. The competencies required for different assignments must be considered in advance to better design team teams. According to the declared competence and interest, the right type of person is selected from the appropriate applicants for different virtual companies.

For selected people, you should inform WIMMA Lab as soon as possible, for example by e-mail, so that they can plan their spending accordingly. It is advisable to provide more detailed information on the start-up and the required operating models. If your own information site has been created for the duration of the project, it is good to add the address to the message.

If one of the elected persons is forced to cancel his / her participation, for example because of access to work, a new person, who is mainly responsible for the necessary skills, will be chosen to replace him / her.

It is also polite for the rest of the applicants to put a message outlining the negative outcome of the interviews and reminding them that the cancellations may still come.
